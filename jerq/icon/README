Directories:

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/16x16" contains 16x16 icons.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/large" contains large or non-16x16 icons.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/texture" contains 16x16 icons which should be replicated
      to produce textured backgrounds.

Programs:

-  "/usr/jerq/bin/icon" is the icon editor (self documenting on button 3).
      When given an icon name to read, it automatically searches
      the current directory, and then "/usr/jerq/icon/16x16",
      "/usr/jerq/icon/texture" and "/usr/jerq/icon/large" in turn.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/texture/INSPECT" can be used to give a look at the 
      different textures; type "INSPECT" in the "texture" directory and 
      then give the name of the texture you want to see: the whole window 
      will be textured with it.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/16x16/CATALOG" displays icons in a window.
      Type "CATALOG *" in "/usr/jerq/icon/16x16" to see all the 16x16 icons,
      or, in general, type "CATALOG <file list>" to see a subset of them.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/large/CATALOG" displays large icons in a window.
      Type "CATALOG *" in "/usr/jerq/icon/large" to see all the large icons,
      or, in general, type "CATALOG <file list>" to see a subset of them.

-  "/usr/jerq/icon/texture/CATALOG" displays 16x16 textures in 48x48 areas
      in a window. Type "CATALOG *" in "/usr/jerq/icon/texture" to see all
      the textures, or, in general, type "CATALOG <file list>" to see a
      subset of them.

Note: the CATALOG programs assume that the icon names start with a character
      different from 'A'..'Z'. No attempts are made to draw icons starting
      with 'A'..'Z'.
