Although 
.UC TROFF
has been the mainstay of document preparation
at Bell Labs for several years,
it has heretofore been very dependent
on one particular typesetter,
the Graphic Systems CAT.
.PP
This paper describes conversion of 
.UC TROFF
to deal with a wide class of typesetters.
.PP
Some of these typesetters provide many more facilities
than the CAT does.
Typical extra features include
more sizes and fonts,
larger alphabets,
and the ability to
create new characters
and to draw graphical objects.
The paper describes the enhancements that permit
.UC TROFF
to take advantage of some
of these capabilities as well.

was originally written by the late Joe Ossanna
in about 1973, in assembly language for the PDP-11.
.UC NROFF , (
which drives terminals instead of a typesetter,
is essentially identical to
.UC TROFF ;
we will use
.UC TROFF '' ``
as a generic term hence\%forth.)
It was rewritten in C around 1975,
and underwent slow but steady evolution until
Ossanna's death late in 1977.
.PP
In spite of some obvious deficiencies
\(em a rebarbative input syntax,
mysterious and undocumented properties in some areas,
and a voracious appetite for computer resources
(especially when used with macro packages and preprocessors like
.UC EQN
and
.UC TBL )
\(em
.UC TROFF
has been the basis of document preparation at
Bell Labs for some years,
and is likely to remain so for years to come.
.PP
Early in 1979,
the Computing Science Research Center
decided to acquire a new typesetter,
primarily because of our interests in typesetting graphics.
At the same time,
the Murray Hill Computer Center
began to investigate the possibility of replacing their
family of aging CAT's
with a new, high-performance typesetter,
simply to keep up with their rapidly expanding load.
.PP
My first thought
(a thought shared by many others)
was that this would be a glorious opportunity
to replace 
.UC TROFF
with a new formatting language:
better designed,
easier to work with,
and of course much faster.
This remains a desirable goal,
but, after quite a bit of thought spread over several
years,
I am still not really much closer to a better design,
let alone an implementation.
Furthermore,
a great deal of software depends on 
.UC TROFF 
\(em
the preprocessors, the macro packages,
and of course all of their documentation and our accumulated expertise.
Tossing this aside is not something to be done lightly.
.PP
Accordingly, in the spring of 1979,
I set about to modify
.UC TROFF
so that it would run hence\%forth without change
on a variety of typesetters.
The ground rule was that
.UC TROFF
should retain its current specifications,
so that existing software like
.UC EQN ,
.UC TBL
and the macro packages would continue to work with it.
.PP
Since much of the rest of this paper
is encrusted with details that could appeal only to
maintainers or masochists,
I will give here a brief summary of what has been done.
Non-specialists can stop reading at the end of the section.
.PP
.UC TROFF
is highly dependent on the Graphic Systems CAT typesetter,
not just in details of code
but also in many aspects of its design.
The language design issues have been largely ignored
(few are truly fundamental),
while the code has been modified
so that dependencies are either eliminated
or at least parameterized.
.PP
.UC TROFF
originally had parameters of the typesetter
compiled into the code,
often in non-obvious ways.
The new version reads a parameter file
each time it is invoked, to
set values for machine resolution,
legal sizes, fonts and characters,
character widths
and the like.
.PP
.UC TROFF
output used to be binary device codes
specific to the CAT and arcane beyond description.
The output of the new version is
.UC ASCII
characters
in a simple and (I hope) universal language
that describes where each character is to be placed
and in what size and font.
A post-processor must be written for each typesetter
to convert this typesetter-independent language
into specific codes for that typesetter.
Post-processors currently exist
for the CAT,
the Mergenthaler Linotron 202,
the Autologic APS-5,
the Tektronix 4014 terminal,
The Imagen Canon laser printer,
Versatec printers,
and a bit-map terminal.
New ones can generally be written in less than a day;
they share much of their code with previous ones.
.PP
The new output language contains information that is not readily
identifiable in the older output.
Most notably, the beginning of each page and line
is marked,
so post-processors can do device-specific optimizations
such as sorting the data vertically or printing it boustrophedonically,
independently of
.UC TROFF .
.PP
Since actual output is done by a post-processor,
not
.UC TROFF ,
new capabilities for graphics have been easy to add.
.UC TROFF
now recognizes commands for drawing diagonal lines,
circles, ellipses, circular arcs,
and quadratic B-splines;
these are used in the

languages.
.PP
A number of limitations have been eased or eliminated.
A document may have an arbitrary number of fonts on any page
(if the output device permits it, of course).
Fonts may be accessed merely by naming them;
``mounting'' is no longer necessary.
Character \H'8'height\H'10' and \S'-10'sl\S'0'a\S'10'nt\S'0' may be set
independently of width.
.PP
The new
.UC TROFF
is about 1000 bytes larger in instruction space
and 13000 bytes larger in data space
(thus guaranteeing that it will not run on
PDP-11/40 style machines).
It runs about as fast as the original version,
though
a simple improvement that I made could be retrofitted into 
the earlier version to keep it about 20% faster.
The post-processors are not included in these time comparisons;
they typically take 10-20% of the
.UC TROFF
time.
.NH
Typesetter Dependencies
.PP
.UC TROFF
turns out to be surprisingly dependent on
the Graphic Systems CAT,
not just in the code but in its design.
.PP
Some of the design dependencies are pretty obvious.
For example, the CAT provides four fonts
(of 102 characters each) and 15 sizes.
The specific sizes
are wired into the syntax of the language:
since the CAT has no sizes larger than 36 points,
.CW \es46
can be uniquely decoded as a 4-point 
.CW 6 ,
while
.CW \es36 
is simply a switch into size 36.
.PP
.UC TROFF
makes the assumption that there are four fonts,
three of which are physically isomorphic
(that is, the same characters appear in the same position in each)
and one ``special'' font
that is logically a part of each of the others.
The reserved font name
.CW S
finds its way into several commands
and receives special treatment in a variety of contexts.
.PP
Some commands have the basic resolution of the
CAT wired into their definition;
for example, the units of the
.CW .ss
command (which sets the size of the inter-word spacing)
are 36th's of an em,
because the CAT typesetter itself works in those units.
.PP
Some command line options reflect idiosyncrasies of the CAT.
For example, the option
.CW -p
requests that the output all be printed in one size;
since the CAT is excruciatingly slow at changing point sizes,
this
prints an approximation to final output
comparatively quickly.
The
.CW -g
option causes font information to appear in the output file
for the benefit of the operations staff at the Murray Hill
Computer Center.
.PP
At the same time,
there are myriad places
where the characteristics of the CAT are an integral part of
the code for
.UC TROFF .
Some of these are quite evident;
others are subtle indeed.
.PP
The most obvious instance is the internal encoding of
a character.
Within
.UC TROFF ,
objects are passed around as 16 bit quantities.
There are two fundamental objects \(em
printable characters and motions.
An object looks like this:
.TS
center;
cw(2) cw(8) cw(4) cw(2) cw(16)
|c0|c0|c0|c0|c0|.
1	4	2	1	8
_
.ft CW
m	s	f	z	c
.ft
_
.TE
If the
.CW m
bit is a 1, the object represents a motion;
if it is zero, the object is something to be printed.
In that case,
.CW s
is the size (actually an index into a table of legal sizes),
.CW f
is the font,
.CW z
is the zero-motion bit
(i.e., no space after printing),
and
.CW c
is the character.
If the high order bit of
.CW c
is set,
the character is to be looked up in a table of
special names
(for example,
.CW 0200
is the hyphen
.CW \e(hy );
otherwise it is
.UC ASCII .
Furthermore,
if
.CW c
is less than octal 40 or greater than octal 370,
the character is actually some encoded control function
or very special character
such as
.CW \ee 
or
.CW \e{ .
.PP
Clearly the tight packing makes it utterly impossible
to add another size or font \(em
there are no bits left over.
It also implies limits on the number of characters
in a font and on the number of special names
(names of the form
.CW \e(xx ).
.PP
Motions are encoded as
.TS
center;
cw(2) cw(2) cw(2) cw(26)
|c0|c0|c0|c0|.
1	1	1	13
_
.ft CW
m	v	n	mag
.ft
_
.TE
.CW m
is the ``motion bit'', which is 1 for a motion,
.CW v
is 1 for a vertical motion,
and
.CW n
is 1 for a negative motion.
The remaining 13 bits give the magnitude.
Since there are only 13 bits,
the maximum amount of motion is 
8191 machine units.
With the CAT's resolution of 432 units per inch,
this is a generous 19 inches.
But for the Linotron 202 (resolution 972/inch),
it is only 8.5 inches.
.PP
Within the code,
certain character values are used in tests and assignments
without identification.
For instance the octal value
.CW 0200
is used (without identification) as a hyphen.
But of course the mask
.CW 0200
also occurs many times.
As might be imagined, it takes some study to determine whether
any particular
.CW 0200
is a hyphen or a mask.
.PP
The basic resolution of the CAT is 432 units per inch
horizontally and 144 vertically.
Character widths are given as the number of units at size 6 points.
There are 72 points in an inch.
Thus the program contains as magic numbers
every factor of 432,
and \(+-1 from each factor as well.
.PP
Finally, 
.UC TROFF
is simply a big program (at least by my standards) \(em
about 7000 lines of virtually uncommented C.
(I am indebted to Lorinda Cherry for a new version of the C beautifier
that made
the code legible, if not comprehensible.)
It was implemented before the recent additions to C,
so there are no
.CW typedef 's
to distinguish among the various kinds of integers,
relatively few macros with arguments,
no internal
.CW static
variables,
and a startling number of global variables
with two-character names.
.PP
None of these remarks should be taken as denigrating
Ossanna's accomplishment with
.UC TROFF .
It has proven a remarkably robust tool,
taking unbelievable abuse from a variety of preprocessors
and being forced into uses that were never conceived of
in the original design,
all with considerable grace under fire.
.NH
Modifying TROFF
.PP
The first step was to widen the 16-bit internal representation of a character
to 32 bits, to accommodate more sizes and fonts.
The current representation is
.TS
center;
cw(2) cw(14) cw(16) cw(2) cw(30)
|c0|c0|c0|c0|c0|.
1	7	8	1	15
_
.ft CW
z	s	f	m	c
.ft
_
.TE
If
.CW m
is 1, bits 16 and 17 are
.CW v
and
.CW n .
Access to this representation is entirely through
macros;
for example, a macro called
.CW cbits
fetches the character bits,
another called
.CW setsfbits
sets the size and font bits, and so on.
.PP
This stage took several weeks of meticulous checking,
since it was necessary to examine every integer
constant, variable and function in the program
to decide whether it was being used to store
an internal character.
These are now all identified and
.CW typedef 'd
for future reference.
.PP
Widening 16 bits to 32 turns out to be quite costly on the PDP-11,
since the program must process
.CW long
integers instead of short ones.
The result is approximately a 25% increase in program size
and perhaps 25% increase in run time.
Furthermore the temporary file in which
.UC TROFF
keeps its macro and string definitions doubles in size
(to 256k bytes).
.PP
Note that at this stage the program has not been changed in any fundamental
way \(em
it still generates CAT output,
so a bit-for-bit regression test against the original version can be performed after each change.
This proved to be very important for maintaining sanity
in both program and programmer.
.NH
Dynamic Machine Parameters
.PP
The next step was to find all the the numbers in the program that depend
on the CAT and replace them by variables.
This also contributed marginally to slower execution,
since many values and expressions that were constants now became variables.
.PP
With parameters identified as such,
the next step was
to make it possible to load a description of
the typesetter each time
.UC TROFF
is run, rather than creating a compiled version for each typesetter.
Accordingly, a set of description files was designed and created
for each typesetter and each font.
The description really comes in two pieces \(em
a table describing parameters of the machine,
and a table of widths for each font.
To illustrate, here is the parameter file for the CAT:

.PP
The
.CW name
is the external 
.UC TROFF
name, one or two characters,
as used in
.CW .ft
and
.CW \ef
commands.
The internal name is not used by
.UC TROFF
itself, but is necessary for the postprocessors.
If the font has
ligatures, they are listed.
It is possible to set the width of the space for each font
separately with the
.CW spacewidth 
command,
not illustrated here.
There is also a keyword
.CW special
to indicate that the font is a ``special'' font \(em
one that is to be searched if the regular font
does not contain the character requested.
There is no limit on the number of special fonts,
but they should be listed last in the
.CW fonts
part of the description file.
.PP
The four columns of data are
the character name,
its width,
its ascender/descender information
(1 \(-> descender, 2 \(-> ascender, 3 \(-> both),
and the actual typesetter code required to print it.
When the point size is
.CW unitwidth ,
the width
is the character width in machine units.
If the name is a single character,
it is taken simply as a normal
.UC ASCII
character.
Two or more characters
indicate a name of the form
.CW \e(xx  ;
there are a handful of historical exceptions like
.CW \e- .
A width of
.CW \&"
indicates that the character is a synonym for the
immediately preceding character,
as in
.CW -
and
.CW hy
above.
Comments may follow the four data fields.
.PP
There are significant advantages to having the font and typesetter
descriptions merely text files that can be edited easily,
but it is too time-consuming to load all this
.UC ASCII
information
each time
.UC TROFF
is invoked.
Thus a separate program called
.CW makedev
is used to compile
it into a binary file that can be read by 
.UC TROFF
in a single read.
When
.UC TROFF
is invoked,
an argument of the form
.CW -Txxx
tells it to load the description file for typesetter
.CW xxx 
from a standard directory.
.PP
Descriptions for the default fonts are compiled into the description file;
if a new font is requested by a
.CW .fp
command,
its description data replaces the original values.
The
.CW .ft
command has been modified so that if the requested font
is not currently ``mounted'',
its description data will be placed in the hidden
font position 0.
Since there is only one such position,
each new non-standard font overlays the previous one.
This mechanism is intended to make
occasional use of non-standard fonts easy;
the
.CW .fp
mechanism remains necessary for other purposes.
.PP
The notion of special fonts has been generalized somewhat \(em
rather than a single special font,
there can be several.
The algorithm currently used is to search for each character
on the current font;
if it is not found there, then the special fonts are searched
in order (as given in the description file).
Other than that,
the treatment of special fonts is essentially unchanged.
.PP
At this stage in the modifications to
.UC TROFF ,
all internal arithmetic is done in terms of
the resolution of the specified typesetter.
The character set and character widths are defined by
the values loaded from the font description.
Indeed, the mapping from character name to what gets printed
is determined by this table \(em
fonts are no longer all isomorphic.
.PP
Although it is certainly convenient for testing during
program development,
it is not clear that loading the font information for
the typesetter each time
.UC TROFF
is invoked is the right way to operate in an environment
that supports only a single kind of typesetter.
In a production mode it might be desirable to compile in
the default information for the standard typesetter.
.NH
Output Language
.PP
The final step is to modify the output of 
.UC TROFF
so that it is typesetter-independent.
The new version of
.UC TROFF
produces output that is not intended to go directly to
a typesetter.
Rather, it is more or less independent of any typesetter,
except that the numbers in it have been computed on the
basis of the resolution specified in the description
file for the intended typesetter.
.PP
The output language is simple:
.P1
.ta .7i
s\f2n\fP	size in points
f\f2n\fP	font as number from 1 to \f2n\fP
c\f2x\fP	ASCII character \f2x\fP
C\f2xy\fP	character \e(\f2xy\fP; terminate \f2xy\fP by white space
H\f2n\fP	go to absolute horizontal position \f2n\fP. (\f2n\fP > 0)
V\f2n\fP	go to absolute vertical position \f2n\fP (down is positive)
h\f2n\fP	go \f2n\fP units horizontally (to the right; \f2n\fP > 0)
v\f2n\fP	go \f2n\fP units vertically (down; \f2n\fP > 0)
\f2nnc\fP	move right \f2nn\fP, then print \f2c\fP (\f2nn\fP is exactly 2 digits!)
n\f2b a\fP	end of line (information only -- no action needed)
	\f2b\fP = space before line, \f2a\fP = after
w	paddable word space (information only -- no action needed)
p\f2n\fP	new page \f2n\fP begins -- set V to 0
x ...\en	device control functions
D ...\en	drawing functions (graphics)
.P2
Encoding small horizontal motions followed by a character as
.I nnc
shrinks the output file size by about 35%
and run-time by about 15%.
.PP
The device control and graphics commands are intended as open-ended
families, to be expanded as needed.
.P1
.ta .7i
x i	init

.PP
The output is guaranteed to be
.UC ASCII ,
and thus amenable to processing by all the normal
Unix
tools.
The language is simple \(em
it is straightforward to write a prototype driver
for a particular typesetter,
especially when one can steal an existing one
as a model,
although it may take some effort to make one of production quality.
This form also demystifies
.UC TROFF
output
and makes it possible for anyone to write other programs
to process or generate it.
.PP
On the other hand,
it is about twice as voluminous as the output intended for
the CAT.
Cleverness (or sacrificing
.UC ASCII -ness)
could bring
it down to not much more than one byte per character printed,
but so far I have not felt this to be very important.
.PP
There is not really much to say about the post-processors.
.UC D202
drives the 202,
.UC DCAT
drives the CAT (although not very efficiently \(em
the vital boustrophedon and size-sorting features are not there),
.UC DAPS
drives the APS-5,
.UC DCAN
drives the Canon,
and
.UC TC
(notice the parallel name structure)
drives the Tektronix 4014.
There are also rough and ready drivers for other display terminals.
.PP
Since it is easy to identify page and line boundaries,
some drivers are able to offer useful features
that were not feasible with the older
.UC TROFF .
For example,
.UC TC
permits the user to ask for specific pages by number,
and to skip back and forth in the document.
.UC D202
displays the output page number on the operator's control panel and will also
stop at specified pages if requested.
An experimental postprocessor
called
.UC DSORT
sorts the intermediate language by vertical position,
to minimize vertical motion;
it is intended for printing complicated 
.UC PIC
diagrams and for circuit diagrams produced by
.UC PLTROFF .
.UC PLTROFF \& (
converts the standard Unix
plot language into
.UC TROFF
commands.)
All of the post-processors can scan their input relatively quickly
to print only selected pages.
.NH
New Things
.PP
During the process of making these changes to
.UC TROFF ,
I have made some changes to the program
that are visible to users
(thus violating the avowed goal of keeping it compatible).
.PP
Some changes are simply the easing of restrictions.
For example,
there is no longer any limit on the number of fonts
that can occur on a page
(if one's typesetter is up to it),
nor does the
.CW .fp
command that requests ``mounting'' a new font
have to occur only at the beginning.
Furthermore, a font may be accessed merely by naming it \(em
the command
.P1
\ef(ARBell Laboratories\efP
.P2
will produce
.P1
\f(ARBell Laboratories\fP
.P2
(The font
.CW AR
is Avant-Garde Book. 
Obviously two-letter font names will have to go.)
.PP
Character sets can be sensibly defined
since they no longer have to all be isomorphic.
Thus, for example, on the 202 the ``printout'' font
.P1
This one
.P2
includes a complete
.UC ASCII
alphabet.
All of the characters have the same width,
even the word space
(defined by the
.CW spacewidth
attribute in the font description file).
Thus this font is suitable for printing program listings
without any special precautions.
On the other hand,
some fonts are rather small,
containing only a handful of characters.
.PP
Larger and smaller point sizes are available,
although there are still some limitations.
For example,
.CW \es72
is still parsed as a 7 point
.CW 2 ,
since changing this would affect at least
.UC EQN
and probably other programs as well.
(Sadly,
.UC EQN
had to be changed
anyway \(em
it also accepts an option of the form
.CW -Txxx .)
But
.CW .ps\ 72
works fine:
each input size is mapped into the closest legal size
for the current typesetter.
Fractional point sizes are not allowed
and may never be.
.PP
Character height and slant may be set independently of character
width, for those typesetters that allow these operations.
.CW \eH'n'
sets the character height to
.CW n
points,
.CW \eH'\(+-n'
sets it to
.CW \(+-n
from the current point size,
and
.CW \eH'0'
restores it to normal height.
.CW \eS'n'
sets the slant to
.CW n
degrees positive or negative;
if 
.CW n
is zero, slanting is turned off.
.PP
Some obsolete commands have been eliminated
(e.g.,
.CW .fz ,
.CW .li ;
the command line options for constant-size printing and
suppressing boustrophedon;
all code related to
.UC GCOS ).
.PP
A new command
.CW .sy
has been added to permit calling another program from
within
.UC TROFF :
.P1
\&.sy \f2command line \fP
.P2
causes 
.I "command line"
to be executed.
The output is
.I not
automatically collected anywhere,
but the new number register
.CW \en($$
(the process id of the
.UC TROFF
process)
can be used
to create unique file names
to be picked up with subsequent
.CW .so
commands.
The built-in string 
.CW \e*(.T
contains the name of the current typesetter
obtained from the
.CW -T
argument or its default.
.NH
Graphics Commands
.PP
The most significant new facility is the ability to draw
simple graphical objects  
\(em diagonal lines, circles, ellipses, arcs, and splines \(em
in
.UC TROFF .
.PP
The new graphical commands are
.P1
.ta 1i
\eD'l\f2 dh dv\fP'	draw line from current position by \f2dh, dv\fP
\eD'c\f2 d\fP'	draw circle of diameter \f2d\fP with left side at current position
\eD'e\f2 d1 d2\fP'	draw ellipse of diameters \f2d1 d2\fP
\eD'a\f2 dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2\fP'
	draw arc from current position to \f2dh1+dh2 dv1+dv2\fP,
	with center at \f2dh1 dv1\fP from current position
\eD'~\f2 dh1 dv1 dh2 dv2 ...\fP'
	draw B-spline from current position by \f2dh1 dv1\fP
	then by \f2dh2 dv2\fP, then by \f2dh2, dv2\fP, then ...
.P2
For example, the input
.CW "\eD'e0.2i 0.1i'"
draws the ellipse
\D'e.2i .1i'\|,
and the input
.CW "\eD'l.2i -.1i'\eD'l.1i .1i'"
will draw the line
\D'l.2i -.1i'\D'l.1i .1i'\|.
The position after a graphical object has been drawn is
at its ``end'', where for circles and ellipses, the end
is at the right side.
As with other commands,
default units are ems horizontally and line spaces vertically.
.PP
Realistically, these commands are not intended for direct use,
but for preprocessors like
.UC PIC  
and
.UC IDEAL .
.PP
The output generated by these commands is shown in the
discussion of 
the
.UC TROFF
output language in an earlier section.
Rather than drawing the shape in 
.UC TROFF ,
a command with the proper parameters is passed through to the device
post-processor,
which does whatever it can with the request.
.NH
Loose Ends
.PP
This version of
.UC TROFF
has been in use
since September of 1979.
Most of our experience with it has been on the
202 and Tektronix scopes, but the CAT and APS-5 drivers have been
exercised to some degree.
.PP
As mentioned, there are some obvious things that could
be improved or that remain to be added.
For instance,
.UC TROFF 's
bracket-building function
.CW \eb
really ought to be implemented by postprocessor,
so that typesetters like the 202 can draw a character like
\v'1'\H'48'{\H'10'\v'-1' directly instead of synthesizing it from pieces.
It also appears to be necessary to add ``modes''
to permit graphical objects to be dotted, dashed, etc.
.PP
Efficiency is always a problem,
and is likely to be so forever,
especially with the proliferation of preprocessors
generating ever more complicated input.
Small improvements (perhaps 10 percent)
can be had from artifices like better table searching.
Placing the temporary file upon which 
.UC TROFF
stores macro definitions in memory is good for another 10-20 percent
on machines like the
.UC VAX 
that have enough memory.
But no order-of-magnitude speedup is likely without a gross revision
of the basic design.
.PP
It is clear that
.UC TROFF
ought to be replaced by something better,
but, as I said above,
it is far from clear how to do the job
a lot better.
So for better or worse,
.UC TROFF
is likely to be with us for a long time.

Acknowledgements
.PP
I am deeply indebted to Ken Thompson and Joe Condon,
without whose efforts in taming the Mergenthaler Linotron 202
the
.UC TROFF
modifications discussed here would be irrelevant.
Thompson also provided most of the character-generating software.
I am also grateful to Chris Van Wyk for the line and circle drawing
algorithms and to Theo Pavlidis for the spline algorithm
used by all the postprocessors.

Appendix:  Summary of Language Changes
.PP
This appendix enumerates the changes to the
.UC TROFF
language since the last printing of
the 
manual.
.SH
Command line arguments
.PP
The argument
.CW -Txxx
loads parameters and character definitions for typesetter
.CW xxx ,
which at the moment is typically one of
.CW 202 ,
.CW aps
or
.CW cat .
.PP
.CW -Fxxx
causes font information to be loaded from
directory
.CW xxx
instead of the default
.CW /usr/lib/font/dev202 .
.SH
Graphics commands
.PP
As described in section 7.
.SH
Other new commands
.PP
.CW .sy
.I commandline
executes the command, then returns.
Output is not captured anyplace.
.PP
.CW .cf
.I file
copies
.I file
into the
.UC TROFF
output file at this point, uninterpreted.
Havoc ensues unless the motions in the file
restore current horizontal and vertical position.
This command hasn't been used much,
and is probably a bad idea anyway.
.PP
.CW .pi
.I program
(pipe the output into
.I program )
now works in  
.UC TROFF
as well as
.UC NROFF ,
since it makes somewhat more sense to allow it.
.PP
.CW \eH'n'
sets the character height to
.CW n
points.
A height of the form
.I \(+-n
is an increment on the current point size;
a height of zero restores the height to the point size.
.PP
.CW \eS'n'
sets the slant to
.CW n
degrees.
.I n
may be negative.
.PP
The number register
.CW $$
contains the process id of the 
.UC TROFF
process.
.PP
The string
.CW .T
contains the name of the current typesetter
(e.g.,
.CW 202 ,
.CW aps ,
.CW cat ).
.PP
The 
.CW .fp
command accepts a third argument that causes the
data for the font to be loaded from that directory.
This has been added as a first step to allowing dynamic character definitions.
.PP
The
.CW .ft
command causes the named font to be loaded on font position 0
(which is in all other ways inaccessible) if the font exists and is not currently mounted
by default or by
a
.CW .fp
command.
The font must be still or again in position 0 when the line is printed.
.PP
Transparent mode 
.CW \e! ) (
has been fixed so that transparent output actually appears
in the output;
thus special commands can be passed through to postprocessors
by witchcraft like
.P1
\&.if "\e*(.T"202" \e!x ...
.P2
(If this makes no sense to you,
you shouldn't be using it anyway.)
.SH
Deletions
.PP
The
.CW .fz
and
.CW .li
commands are no more.
The
.CW -p ,
.CW -g
and
.CW +n
command line arguments have also been eliminated,
as has the
.CW hp
number register.
