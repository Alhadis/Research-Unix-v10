Files of interest:

mlyacc.doc		- User's manual for ML-Yacc
mlyacc.sml		- ML version of yacc.

sample.grm		\
sample.lex		 >   Sample interactive calculator program.
sample.sml		/
sample.input

pascal.grm		- Grammar for Berkeley Pascal, hacked to be SLR,
			    though that is no longer necessary because
			    ML-Yacc now supports LALR(1).
pascal.lex

ml.grm			- grammar for ML.  Not debugged.

Source files for building mlyacc.sml:
mlyacc.hdr.sml		- code that must be loaded before loading mpc.grm.sml.
mlyacc.grm		- grammar for ML version of yacc.
mlyacc.lex		- lexer for ML version of yacc
mlyacc.main.sml		- ties the above together

To build mlyacc.sml (necessary only if you edit one of the four files above):
parseGen "mlyacc.grm"  produces "mlyacc.grm.sml"
lexGen "mlyacc.lex"    produces "mlyacc.lex.sml"
cat mlyacc.hdr.sml mlyacc.grm.sml mlyacc.lex.sml mlyacc.main.sml >mlyacc.sml
