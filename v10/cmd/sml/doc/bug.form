Bug reports are most useful if you can narrow down the cause of the bug
to as small a fragment of code as possible.  Also, please check src/doc/bugs
to see if your bug is already known.  
Suggestions on how to improve the compiler
are also welcome, even if they don't identify a specific bug.  Examples of
unhelpful error messages are also useful.
