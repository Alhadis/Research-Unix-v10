#	@(#)Devices	1.8

# Some sample entries:
# NOTE - all lines must have at least 5 fields 
#    use '-' for unused fields
# The Devices file is used in conjuction with the Dialers file.
# Types that appear in the 5th field must be either built-in
#  functions (801, Sytek, TCP, Unetserver, DK)
#  or standard functions whose name appears in the first
#  field in the Dialers file.
# Two escape characters may appear in this file:
# - \D which means don't translate the phone #/token
# - \T translate the phone #/token using the Dialcodes file
# Both refer to the phone number field in the Systems file (field 5)
# \D should always be used with entries in the Dialers file, since the
# Dialers file can contain a \T to expand the number if necessary.
# \T should only be used with builtin functions that require expansion
# NOTE: - if a phone number is expected and a \D or \T is not present
#	a \T is used for a builtin, and \D is used for an entry
#	referencing the Dialers file. (see examples below)
