Software shipment information.  [better documentation forthcoming ...]

All files and directories, except for those in /usr/spool/uucppublic,
are rooted at the shipment/installation directory named by
$INSTALLROOT.  The $INSTALLROOT hierarchy is similar to the System V
/usr hierarchy.

The $INSTALLROOT/ship subdirectory is automatically maintained by
shipin and shipout.  If you expect to receive future shipments then
do not change files in this directory.

pax is the Bell Labs implementation of the proposed POSIX (01/90)
portable archive interchange command.  The default output format is
`cpio -c'.  The pax delta format is a Bell Labs extension.

The following assumes:

	INSTALLROOT=<path name of software installation root directory>

After each shipment:

	<follow specific shipment instructions>
	cd $INSTALLROOT
	ship/shipin

`ship/shipin -n' shows actions but does not unbundle or build.
`ship/shipin -s <dir>' unbundles from <dir> rather than /usr/spool/uucppublic.
`ship/shipin -u' unbundles the shipment but does not build.
`ship/shipin -i' copies from spool area but does not unbundle or build.

Any non-option arguments to shipin are passed as arguments to the
generating make or shell script for each component.

To pass the shipment to another machine (requires ksh):

	# rcp			# TO=host:ship
	# uucp			# TO=machine!user
	# list of files		# TO=%list
	# remote dk pull script	# TO=%pull
	cd $INSTALLROOT
	ship/shipin -i	# if not installed on this machine
	cd ship
	shipout $TO

{rcp,uucp} initiate copies whereas {list,pull} generate information on
stdout.  {uucp} copies to an intermediate spool area on the other machine
whereas {rcp,list,pull} are relative to $INSTALLROOT on the other machine.

To copy a command <cmd> from $INSTALLROOT to a new root you must copy:

	$INSTALLROOT/bin/<cmd>
	$INSTALLROOT/lib/<cmd>

to the new root directory for all interdependent <cmd>'s.  Depending on
<cmd>, only one of the above files/directories may exist.

The files below may appear on the shipment side, the installation side,
or both.  <installer-login> and <shipper-system> are defined in the
shipment mail announcement.

Each shipment is identified by a two part version number [R]YYMMDD

	R	release -- if specified then it must match for compatibility
	YYMMDD	shipment year, month and day number

/usr/spool/uucppublic/<installer-login>/<shipper-system> directory hierarchy:

	<shipper-login>.<YYMMDD>	shipment control directory
	<shipper-login>.<YYMMDD>/manifest list of all files in shipment

$INSTALLROOT directory hierarchy:

	bin/		executable binaries and scripts
	include/	common header files
	lib/		object archives a common data
	man/		man page subtree
	    man1/	command man pages
	    man3/	library man pages
	    man8/	adminstration and maintenance man pages
	src/		source subtree
	    cmd/	command source
	    lib/	library source
	ship/		shipment and installation info

$INSTALLROOT/ship contents:

	README		installation info
	!<mach_user>	shipment installation message for machine!user
	ship.body	optional shipment announcement main body
	ship.head	optional shipment announcement header
	ship.tail	optional shipment announcement trailer
	shipcost	show relative cost of delta/update shipment
	shipcrate	crate all components for shipout
	shipin		unbundle, build and install shipment
	shiplist	shipout using name-tool list
	shipop		shipin/shipout support executable
	shipout		split and send shipment
	shipslog	shipment log and recipient address info
	shipswab	clean old stuff from the ship area
	shipyard	shipment support tools component name
	lib*		library components
	*		command components

$INSTALLROOT/ship/<component> contents:

	<[R]YYMMDD>	information for the <[R]YYMMDD> shipment
	base		link to the newest pax base archive
	delta		link to the newest pax delta archive
	in.log		shipin log
	items		required components (excluding this one)
	list		optional list of persons to send to
	message		optional message to include in shipment announcement
	owner		mail address for installation report
	release		the the current shipment release number
	report		optional list of $INSTALLROOT relative files to report

$INSTALLROOT/ship/<component>/<[R]YYMMDD> contents:

	<[R]YYMMDD>	pax delta archive for ../[R]YYMMDD/base
	<[R]YYMMDD>.<NNN> delta archive split for uucp
	BUILT		present if release build succeeded
	ERROR		present if release build failed
	GENERATED	present if base archive was generated from a delta
	UNCRATED	present if release uncrate succeeded
	base		pax base archive
	base.<NNN>	base archive split for uucp
	items		items for this release
	message		message for this release
	owner		owner for this release
	report		report for this release

Each component $NAME is extracted into either $INSTALLROOT/src/lib/$NAME
or $INSTALLROOT/src/cmd/$NAME.  The following are attempted, in order,
to build and install $NAME under $INSTALLROOT:

	$INSTALLROOT/bin/nmake -f Makefile install
	mamexec install < Mamfile
	make -f makefile install
	sh Makescript

where Mamfile, Makescript and makefile are usually generated from the
corresponding nmake Makefile.
